UserMan - A User Management System
==================================

<img src="https://github.com/rejectedsoftware/userman/blob/master/public/images/logo-256.png" align="left">
This package doubles as a library that provides an embeddable user management
interface for websites and as a standalone server that provides a user
administration front end, as well as a RESTful service that can be used for
authentication or to manage user accounts.

A major revision of the source code is currently underway. More instructions
will be added in that process.
